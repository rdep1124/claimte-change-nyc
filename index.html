			<p class="intro">The past few months of 2023 showcased climate emergencies after one another; wildfires spanning across New York State, rain storms drowning the city and temperatures way above predicted. Complications that have risen may have been unexpected in their severity, but they are logical consequences of prior action (or lack thereof) and policy taken to tackle climate change. The results have led to concerns for New Yorkers of all different demographics. As seen with the most recent storm in New York in late September, poor infrastructure affects everyone, from those who take limousines and private cars to those riding the subway or the bus.

				Fossil fuels are a leading cause of climate change around the world, as the greenhouse gases produced absorb the heat and re-remit it into the Earth’s atmosphere. New York City’s energy sources are incredibly reliant on fossil fuels across all areas of energy usage. These include residential, commercial/institutional and construction, which totaled <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/environment/education/climate-change-introduction-presentation.pdf" target=_blank>15 million metric tons</a> of “Carbon Dioxide equivalent” (MtCO2e). While these high numbers are true for almost all big cities around the world, it is clear that New York City’s energy sources contribute greatly to the climate crisis.

				If 2023's Summer is any indication of the future ahead of New Yorkers, what can residents of New York City expect in the foreseeable future?

					<h4>Rising Temperatures</h4>
					<img src="images/globalwarm.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to NASA, the past summer was the hottest on record <a href="">across the globe</a>. Unfortunately, the past eight years, since 2014, have all been reported to be the hottest on record, pointing to increasing temperatures over the last decade. In particular, July 4th was reported as the hottest day ever on Earth in recorded history. In New York City, climate change can exascerbate already devastating heat waves with the potential to cause <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/nyc-climate-dashboard/overview/" target=_blank>several health complications</a> such as heat strokes and exhaustion.

					<h4>Infrastructure Issues</h4>
					<img src="images/bus.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">The New York City subway system, as widely recognized and documented, faces challenges related to weather conditions and its subterranean nature, particularly in managing flooding and rainstorms. Addressing these issues is a complex and long-term undertaking. According to a report from the comptroller's office <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment nyc-flooding-climate-change-infrastructure-limitations-rcna118170" target=_blank>via NBC News</a>, the city received a federal grant totaling $15 billion after Hurricane Sandy, with the intention of improving the subway system, among other resources. However, it's worth noting that more than 73% of the grant funding remains unallocated. Approximately $4 billion of the grant has yet to be earmarked for addressing structural issues within the subway as of June 2022. Icon Credit: Alzam </figcaption>

					<h4>Changing Weather Conditions</h4>
					<img src="images/wind.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">As average temperatures change by rising, a new climate with extreme heat can lead to an increased frequency of dramatic weather events. Warmer temperature causes drastic shifts in precipitation because of the higher moisture in the air. In a recent <a href="https://nexusmedianews.com/top_story/nyc-rain/" target=_blank>interview with MSNBC</a>, Louise Yeung, the comptroller's chief climate officer, highlighted the growing impact of changing weather conditions in New York City. Yeung noted that heavy rainstorms, like the ones observed in early Oct., are becoming increasingly common as climate change intensifies. The city's infrastructure is facing a challenge, as it struggles to keep pace with the rate at which the climate is changing. As a result, the occurrence of rainstorms and hurricanes is likely to continue posing formidable challenges in the future. Icon Credit: komsiatu</figcaption>

					<h4>Fiercer Weather Conditions</h4>
					<img src="images/rain.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">As a result of climate change, New York City may confront an alarming increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events, such as those experienced during Hurricane Ida. The city could anticipate <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/nyc-climate-dashboard/overview/" target=_blank>1.5 times</a> more extreme precipitation days, potentially leading to intense flash flooding, which poses a significant risk to its infrastructure and resilience in the face of fiercer weather conditions.
